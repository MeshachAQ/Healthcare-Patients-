# Healthcare-Patients-
I explored Healthcare data set using Power BI

# About Dataset
Hello And Welcome. In Today’s Presentation, I Am Excited To Take You Through The Healthcare Dataset.
I Am Really Excited To Be Doing This Presentation As It Has Given Me The Opportunity To Dive Into, And Gain Insightful Information About This Special Project Including But Not Limited To Patients per Department, Total patients, Visits by severity, Most stayed patients, 
Billings and costs.

# Process
I am excited to state that, I took the necessary process in ensuring that this project has passed through the necessary steps and procedure before finally arriving at the final result.
1. Firstly, this dataset was converted from text file(csv) to excel worksheet.
2. I then did some datatype changes in excel even before importing to Tableau
3. I later proceeded to converting the remaining datatypes in tableau but before that, I had to bring all of my files to tableau.
4. So I uploaded a total of 8 excel files to tableau. You can find the files attached to this report.
5. After bring all of the files, I then had to join the files since although separate files, it’s one big file in general and so I joined all other files using  visit worksheet as the base.
6. I then proceeded to doing my calculations using the calculated function in tableau and creating my visuals.

# Objective
